# Simple Liver Exchange Optimizer
## Overview
The Simple Liver Exchange Optimizer is a Java application created to facilitate the matching process between liver donors and recipients. The program aims to optimize the exchange process by considering various factors to improve the matching success rate.

## Features
- Efficient matching algorithm to pair donors with compatible recipients.
- Classes representing individuals involved in liver exchanges.
- `Main.java` as the entry point, which runs the optimization process and outputs results.

## Files
- `Donor.java`: Represents a liver donor and their attributes.
- `Recipient.java`: Represents a liver recipient and the required attributes for a match.
- `Person.java`: A general class encapsulating shared attributes of both donors and recipients.
- `Main.java`: Contains the main method that orchestrates the matching and optimization logic.
